# Cancer Genome Analysis - Africa (Virtual)

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. In Africa, nearly 1 million cases and over 0.5 million deaths were reported in 2018. Being a genetic disease, its burden and outcome are influenced by baseline genetics that vary across human populations. However, studies on cancer genetic susceptibility and interventions are largely based in the global north, resulting in disproportionate representation of African datasets and research. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the widening global disparities in cancer genomics research to include more global populations. 

This new course, in collaboration with the <a href="https://aortic-africa.org/" target="_blank">AORTIC</a>, will provide Africa-based scientists with the requisite skills in processing, analysing, and interpreting data from cancer genomes. Participants will be equipped with the essential informatics skills and knowledge required to begin analysing next generation sequencing data and carry out some of the most common types of analysis in somatic genome studies.  Participants will benefit from hands-on practical exercises in mutation calling, driver gene identification, mutational signature analysis and RNA deconvolution. By analysing real-world datasets, students will gain valuable skills that they can later apply at their institutions. Guest seminars will highlight translational applications of genomics in oncology, ethical aspects, and data platforms. This will contribute directly to the much-needed capacity building for cancer research, and scientists will be able to strengthen the application of genomics in clinical practice, public health and policy needs. 

The course will be led by experts in cancer genomics from Africa and Latin America, as well as research and industry experts based in the USA and UK. 

## Course objective

To train Africa-based scientists to analyse genomics data from cancer samples. Applying African datasets, participants will benefit from hands-on practical exercises in mutation calling, driver gene identification, mutational signature analysis and RNA deconvolution.

### Topics to be covered

Data formats and organisation in cancer NGS studies
Somatic mutation calling
Driver gene identification and oncoplots
Mutational signature analysis
Structural Variants
Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, participants should be able to:

Perform QC assessment of somatic NGS data
Explain the algorithmic concepts behind somatic variant calling 
Perform mutation calling on cancer sequencing files 
Identify driver genes associated with tumorigenesis
Generate oncoplots to summarise the impact of mutations on cancer-associated genes
Identify mutational signatures active in cancer samples
Participants are required to take the following pre-course modules (they will be provided):

Unix/Linux
Sample collection, preparation, storage and processing
Molecular diagnostic applications and limitations
Next generation sequencing technologies
Online databases
